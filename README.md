# NSB_characterization
The folder contains two subfolders which in turn contain Python-scripts (Jupyter Notebook) and data files for processing experimental data,
namely measurements of BP adsorption/desorption to/from sensing surface in SPR analytical platform. Curves represents binding and unbinding
of BP proteins to/from functionalized surface and allow to extimate its rates.\
Every subfolder contain script with different approaches of processing and estimation, while data files are the same.
